XEOS Software License
=====================

About
-----

The XEOS Software License is an OpenSource/Free software license attempting to address issues found in other licenses of the same kind.

It was originally created for the XEOS operating system, and its foundation libraries like XSFoundation.

Basically, it's a kind of mix between the BSD(s), MIT and BOOST software licenses, attempting to bring the good parts of each one into a single license, with a few additional clauses (read the «Goals» section for more details).

It has not been yet recognised as a valid software license by the FSF, as I wasn't able to get in touch.  
But I hope it will be in a short time.
